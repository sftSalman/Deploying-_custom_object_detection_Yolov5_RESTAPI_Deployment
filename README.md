#Object Detection using YOLOv4
This project is an implementation of object detection using the YOLOv4 algorithm, which is a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm for object detection. The project includes pre-trained weights for the YOLOv4 model, which can be used to detect a wide range of objects in images and videos.
